   - This file provides is an example configuration file for the PRINT Java API 
   - by PARCIFAL and can be considered as the default configuration.
   - 
   - This configuration enables DEBUG output to the console and results in a 
   - single log file that collects all messages written to the LOG. Each 
   - session has its own log file with a name referencing the time at which it 
   - was created in the following format:
   - 
   -    filename:   "./log/" Y "." m "." d "-" H "." M "." S ".csv"
   -    
   -    Y:  current year formatted as four digits
   -    m:  current month formatted as two digits
   -    d:  current day of the month formatted as two digits
   -    H:  current hour of the day for the 24-hours clock, formatted as two
   -        digits
   -    M:  current minute within the hour formatted as two digits
   -    S:  current second within the minute formatted as two digits
   - 
   - The location attribute of the LOG element is formatted using the 
   - java.lang.String#format(String, Object...) method, having a LocalDateTime 
   - object containing the current date-time as the first argument. Check out 
   - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html for 
   - more information about the formatting syntax.
